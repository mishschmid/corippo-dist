Built in the 17th century on the site of an earlier Roman structure, the bridge is a fine example of medieval stonework, with its elegant curves providing a dramatic visual contrast to the wild, rugged landscape of the Verzasca Valley. Although partially destroyed by a flood in 1868, it was carefully reconstructed in 1960, preserving its historical and architectural significance.",{"type":29,"children":34},[35],{"type":25,"text":36},"Renowned as one of the valley’s most iconic landmarks, the Ponte dei Salti draws visitors from around the world. Many come to photograph its postcard-perfect arches and the crystal-clear river below, while others use it as a starting point for hiking the surrounding trails. The bridge is also a popular spot for swimming and sunbathing, as the smooth rocks and inviting pools beneath it offer a picturesque place to relax in the summer months.",{"type":29,"children":38},[39],{"type":25,"text":40},"A unique tradition at the Ponte dei Salti is bridge diving—adventurous visitors leap from the roughly 10-meter-high structure into the chilly, emerald waters below. This activity, while thrilling, carries risks due to slippery rocks and the cold, fast-moving river, and caution is strongly advised. The area is also favored by scuba divers, who are drawn to the river’s remarkable clarity and fascinating underwater rock formations.",{"type":29,"children":42},[43],{"type":25,"text":44},"Beyond its recreational appeal, the bridge is a window into the region’s history and culture. Nearby, visitors can admire an 18th-century chapel and the historic church of Beata Vergine degli Angeli, further enriching the experience of this enchanting corner of Ticino.","Rich Text Test River",[],{"documentId":48,"name":49,"type":50,"billboard":10,"highlights":51,"rich_texts":52,"media":53},"kcc4es7mi1yu8o0fxl1uookt","Media | River Hangout","image",[],[],[54,59],{"name":55,"media":56},"Hanging out at the River Media",{"caption":10,"name":57,"url":58,"alternativeText":10},"Casa Gabriela.jpg","/uploads/Casa_Gabriela_153909edc9.jpg",{"name":60,"media":61},"Image 2 Hanging out the River",{"caption":10,"name":62,"url":63,"alternativeText":10},"Casa Mugaia.jpg","/uploads/Casa_Mugaia_588b640d79.jpg",1761810917880]
