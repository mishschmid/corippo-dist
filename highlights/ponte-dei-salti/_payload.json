Built in the 17th century on the site of an earlier Roman structure, the bridge is a fine example of medieval stonework, with its elegant curves providing a dramatic visual contrast to the wild, rugged landscape of the Verzasca Valley. Although partially destroyed by a flood in 1868, it was carefully reconstructed in 1960, preserving its historical and architectural significance.",{"type":27,"children":32},[33],{"type":24,"text":34},"Renowned as one of the valley’s most iconic landmarks, the Ponte dei Salti draws visitors from around the world. Many come to photograph its postcard-perfect arches and the crystal-clear river below, while others use it as a starting point for hiking the surrounding trails. The bridge is also a popular spot for swimming and sunbathing, as the smooth rocks and inviting pools beneath it offer a picturesque place to relax in the summer months.",{"type":27,"children":36},[37],{"type":24,"text":38},"A unique tradition at the Ponte dei Salti is bridge diving—adventurous visitors leap from the roughly 10-meter-high structure into the chilly, emerald waters below. This activity, while thrilling, carries risks due to slippery rocks and the cold, fast-moving river, and caution is strongly advised. The area is also favored by scuba divers, who are drawn to the river’s remarkable clarity and fascinating underwater rock formations.",{"type":27,"children":40},[41],{"type":24,"text":42},"Beyond its recreational appeal, the bridge is a window into the region’s history and culture. Nearby, visitors can admire an 18th-century chapel and the historic church of Beata Vergine degli Angeli, further enriching the experience of this enchanting corner of Ticino.","Rich Text Test River",[],{"documentId":46,"name":47,"type":48,"highlight":10,"rich_texts":49,"media":50},"kcc4es7mi1yu8o0fxl1uookt","Media | River Hangout","image",[],[51,56],{"name":52,"media":53},"Hanging out at the River Media",{"caption":10,"name":54,"url":55,"alternativeText":10},"Casa Gabriela.jpg","/uploads/Casa_Gabriela_153909edc9.jpg",{"name":57,"media":58},"Image 2 Hanging out the River",{"caption":10,"name":59,"url":60,"alternativeText":10},"Casa Mugaia.jpg","/uploads/Casa_Mugaia_588b640d79.jpg",1761482893044]
