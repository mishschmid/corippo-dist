Built in the 17th century on the site of an earlier Roman structure, the bridge is a fine example of medieval stonework, with its elegant curves providing a dramatic visual contrast to the wild, rugged landscape of the Verzasca Valley. Although partially destroyed by a flood in 1868, it was carefully reconstructed in 1960, preserving its historical and architectural significance.",{"type":29,"children":34},[35],{"type":25,"text":36},"Renowned as one of the valley’s most iconic landmarks, the Ponte dei Salti draws visitors from around the world. Many come to photograph its postcard-perfect arches and the crystal-clear river below, while others use it as a starting point for hiking the surrounding trails. The bridge is also a popular spot for swimming and sunbathing, as the smooth rocks and inviting pools beneath it offer a picturesque place to relax in the summer months.","Rich Text || Ponte dei Salti 1",[],{"documentId":40,"name":41,"type":42,"billboard":10,"highlights":43,"rich_texts":44,"media":45,"video":10,"grid":10},"kcc4es7mi1yu8o0fxl1uookt","Media | River Hangout","image",[],[],[46,51],{"name":47,"media":48},"Hanging out at the River Media",{"caption":10,"name":49,"url":50,"alternativeText":10},"Casa Gabriela.jpg","/uploads/Casa_Gabriela_153909edc9.jpg",{"name":52,"media":53},"Image 2 Hanging out the River",{"caption":10,"name":54,"url":55,"alternativeText":10},"Casa Mugaia.jpg","/uploads/Casa_Mugaia_588b640d79.jpg",{"documentId":57,"name":58,"type":15,"billboard":10,"highlights":59,"rich_texts":60,"media":83,"video":10,"grid":10},"b9c8e7wz3jzpaskys9tn7ooq","Block || Rich Text Ponte dei Salti 1",[],[61],{"documentId":62,"richText":63,"name":82},"is0c062y9gy9g4ogadvv8esr",[64,68,72,76,79],{"type":29,"children":65},[66],{"type":25,"text":67},"A unique tradition at the Ponte dei Salti is bridge diving—adventurous visitors leap from the roughly 10-meter-high structure into the chilly, emerald waters below.
