With its cluster of stone houses, slate rooftops, and narrow cobbled lanes, the village offers a glimpse into a bygone era. Once Switzerland&#39;s smallest municipality, Corippo had just nine residents as of December 2019. </p></div><div class="text-block" data-v-2cbc18e7><h2 data-v-2cbc18e7>Historical Heritage</h2><p data-v-2cbc18e7> Founded in 1822 after separating from the larger commune of Vogorno, Corippo maintained its independence for nearly two centuries. In 2020, it merged with neighboring villages to form the municipality of Verzasca. Despite its small size, Corippo boasts a rich architectural heritage. The entire village center is protected under a national conservation order, and in 1975, it was recognized by the European Architectural Heritage Congress as an exemplary model of historical preservation. </p></div><div class="text-block" data-v-2cbc18e7><h2 data-v-2cbc18e7>Preservation &amp; Innovation</h2><p data-v-2cbc18e7> To combat depopulation and breathe new life into the village, the Fondazione Corippo 1975 initiated an innovative project: transforming Corippo into an &quot;albergo diffuso&quot; or &quot;scattered hotel.&quot; This concept repurposes vacant homes into guest accommodations, allowing visitors to experience the village authentically while supporting its preservation. </p></div><div class="text-block" data-v-2cbc18e7><h2 data-v-2cbc18e7>Today&#39;s Corippo</h2><p data-v-2cbc18e7> Today, Corippo stands as a testament to sustainable tourism and cultural heritage.
